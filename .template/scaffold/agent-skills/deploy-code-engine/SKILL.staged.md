# Deploy to IBM Cloud Code Engine

Same single container as everywhere else (API + SPA, port 8080), run as a Code Engine app.
The entry point is `infra/deploy/ce-deploy.sh` — idempotent, safe to rerun, builds the image in
the cloud from the working tree (no local Docker). Details: `deploy/README.md`.

Things that happen automatically so you don't handle them:

- **Project, registry namespace, registry secret**: created if missing. The registry secret
  needs an IAM API key the first time — `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY` in the environment or
  `IAM_API_KEY=` in `.env.production` (the script keeps it out of the app secret).
- **Migrations**: the image migrates its own schema at boot (`MIGRATE_ON_START`, production
  default, advisory-locked). No manual step.
- **URL-dependent env**: the script reads the real app URL from Code Engine and injects
  derived values into the `app-env` secret, then rolls a revision — `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, or on
  the oauth-proxy flavor `OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL` + `OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS` + a
  generated-once cookie secret. `.env.production` is never modified; explicit values there
  override derivation.

## Preconditions (ask the user, don't guess)

- `ibmcloud` CLI with `code-engine` + `container-registry` plugins, logged in
  (`ibmcloud login --sso` is interactive — the user runs it, not you), resource group
  targeted (or pass `-g`)
- A reachable PostgreSQL — typically IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL; its connection
  string in `DATABASE_URL`. Code Engine has no in-cluster database convention: the script
  refuses to deploy without `DATABASE_URL`.

## Deploy — first time and every time

```bash
# 1. Production env — never commit this file
cp .env.production.example .env.production   # fill in DATABASE_URL and the values only you
                                             # can know (secrets, IdP client config); leave
                                             # URL-dependent values on their example values

# 2. One command
./infra/deploy/ce-deploy.sh -p <project>           # -g <resource-group>, -r <registry-namespace>
```

First run: expect the cloud-side build to take a few minutes, and on the base flavor a
placeholder `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is seeded so the first revision can boot — the script swaps in
the real URL and rolls a fresh revision before it exits. On the oauth-proxy flavor the
script also deploys an `oauth2-proxy` front app and makes the main app project-only
(identity headers can't be spoofed from the internet); the URL to share is the proxy's.

## Verify — before telling the user it's live

The deploy summary prints the application URL and every `Derived env:` value.

```bash
ibmcloud ce app get --name cen-starter          # Ready
curl -s https://<app-url>/api/health            # {"status":"ok"}
```

Open the URL: sign-in must work end-to-end. If auth fails, compare the `Derived env:` lines
against the real URL — an explicit override in `.env.production` that drifted is the usual
cause. Promote the first admin by setting `role = 'admin'` on the user's row in the database.

## Update an existing deployment

Rerun `./infra/deploy/ce-deploy.sh -p <project>` — new code gets a fresh cloud build, env changes
re-apply the secret, and every update is a new revision. Schema changes need nothing extra
(boot-time migration). Rollback is `ibmcloud ce app get` (list revisions) and routing
traffic back. To manage migrations manually instead: set `MIGRATE_ON_START=false` in
`.env.production` and run `DATABASE_URL='<production url>' pnpm --filter @cen/backend db:migrate`
from a checkout before deploying.

## When something is broken

Switch to `.agents/skills/debug-code-engine/` — don't debug ad hoc.
