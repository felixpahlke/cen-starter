# Deploy to OpenShift

The app ships as one container: the API serves the built SPA on port 8080, and the image
applies its own database migrations at boot. `deploy/deploy.sh` does the heavy lifting and
is safe to rerun. Reference details live in [deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md).

> 🤖 **With your agent:** "Deploy this to OpenShift, namespace `<name>`, auto-deploy." —
> the `deploy-openshift` skill runs this whole guide and verifies the result. Do it by
> hand once so you know what exists in the cluster afterwards.

## Before you start

1. **Cluster access.** You need an OpenShift namespace you may deploy to — for CE
   engagements, ask your engagement or tech lead which cluster/namespace to use. The starter
   does not provision a cluster.
2. **`oc` CLI** — `brew install openshift-cli`.
3. **Log in:** open the OpenShift web console → your name (top right) → **Copy login
   command** → paste the `oc login --token=… --server=…` line into your terminal. Check
   with `oc whoami`.

## Configure production values

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production    # never commit this file
```

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` — generate one: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` — **leave it on the example value.** The script reserves the route
  hostname before the first deploy and injects the real URL into the app secret itself
  (it prints what it derived). Set it only to override, e.g. for a custom domain.
- `DATABASE_URL` — **leave it unset** to get an in-cluster PostgreSQL (pilot/demo grade),
  deployed and wired up automatically. For real engagements, set it to a managed
  PostgreSQL and nothing extra is deployed.

## Path A — auto-deploy (recommended for internal tools and pilots)

One-time setup; afterwards **`git push` to `main` is the deploy**. The cluster builds the
image itself — no local Docker needed.

The repository must be pushed, and GitHub CLI must be logged in to its host. IBM project
repositories normally use `github.ibm.com`, but an existing `origin` is respected:

```bash
gh auth status --hostname github.ibm.com
# If needed: gh auth login --hostname github.ibm.com --web
./deploy/deploy.sh -n <namespace> --autodeploy
```

The script generates and registers a read-only SSH deploy key, creates the build pipeline,
grants the namespace-scoped webhook role, registers the webhook through `gh`, verifies GitHub
can reach it, starts the first build, and waits for rollout. No GitHub token goes in chat or
`.env.production`.

## Path B — explicit image deploys (client projects, release gates)

Build and push yourself, deploy a specific tag:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f deploy/Dockerfile -t <registry>/<repo>/my-app:v1 .
docker push <registry>/<repo>/my-app:v1
./deploy/deploy.sh -n <namespace> -i <registry>/<repo>/my-app:v1
```

`--platform linux/amd64` matters on Apple Silicon — clusters run amd64.

## Verify

```bash
oc get route -n <namespace>              # note the host
curl https://<route-host>/api/health     # {"status":"ok"}
```

Open the route in the browser and log in end-to-end. If auth requests fail, the usual
cause is an overridden `BETTER_AUTH_URL` that doesn't match the route URL exactly — the
deploy summary prints the derived value it actually used. Promote the first admin by
setting `role = 'admin'` on that user's row in the database.

With IBM App ID, add the printed `/oauth2/callback` URL under the App ID instance →
**Manage Authentication → Authentication settings → Add web redirect URI**.

## Updating

- **Auto-deploy:** `git push`. Build, rollout, and schema migration happen on their own.
- **Explicit:** build + push a new tag, rerun `deploy.sh -i <new-tag>`.
- **Env change:** edit `.env.production`, rerun `deploy.sh`, then
  `oc rollout restart deploy/<app-name>`.

Something broken? Ask your agent — the `debug-openshift` skill exists for exactly that.
