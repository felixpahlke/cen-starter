# Changelog

Template releases. Projects created from this template can pull updates from the `upstream`
remote (set up by `pnpm bootstrap`); this file tells you what you're pulling.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), semver on `cen.templateVersion`.

## [Unreleased]

- `pnpm dev` now owns the complete local lifecycle: Ctrl-C or termination stops the native
  app processes and runs `docker compose down`, while preserving database data in its volume.
- Added the same ready-to-use development admin (`admin@example.com` / `ChangeMe`) to every
  database-backed auth variant. Local auth uses an idempotent `pnpm db:seed`; OAuth assigns
  the role when that exact Dex identity first authenticates, using its real OIDC subject.
  `no-database` retains API-key auth.
- `pnpm dev` now validates every selected stack port together and rejects silent Vite port
  shifts. OAuth development ports are configurable through `DEX_PORT` and
  `OAUTH_PROXY_PORT`.
- Added a structural setup gate for agents: post-setup feature skills remain staged and
  undiscoverable until a successfully bootstrapped, clean, verified project is finalized.
  Flavor finalization promotes only compatible skills; the flavor matrix now tests the full
  bootstrap-to-finalize lifecycle.
- Made guided setup outcome-focused for beginners, clarified the OAuth proxy decision and
  self-contained local IdP, and required agents starting from empty workspaces to choose a
  user-named project in a durable visible location before cloning. Interactive bootstrap no
  longer silently inherits `cen-starter`, while an explicit `--name cen-starter` remains valid
  for template work or intentionally named projects.
- Added a concise workstation-preparation skill covering Git, NVM, pnpm, Rancher Desktop,
  IBM Bob, editor support, and the OpenShift and IBM Cloud deployment CLIs.
- Removed skill-discovery instructions from `AGENTS.md`; coding harnesses discover skills.
- Replaced the GitHub Actions workflow with local `pnpm verify` and
  `pnpm verify:flavors` commands. Flavor verification derives all standalone flavors and
  supported combinations from their manifests and checks disposable copies of the current
  working tree.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-09

Deployment convenience restored from the old template, adapted to the single-image model.

- **Migrate-on-start**: the production image applies pending migrations at boot
  (drizzle-orm runtime migrator over the bundled SQL, under a Postgres advisory lock;
  `MIGRATE_ON_START=false` opts out). The manual pre-deploy migration step is gone.
- **In-cluster PostgreSQL by convention**: `deploy.sh` deploys a pilot-grade Postgres
  (`deploy/openshift/postgres.yaml`) and wires `DATABASE_URL` automatically whenever
  `.env.production` doesn't provide one; set `DATABASE_URL` for a managed database.
- **`deploy.sh --autodeploy`**: one-time setup of ImageStream + Docker-strategy BuildConfig
  + GitHub (Enterprise) webhook + image trigger — afterwards `git push` to `main` builds
  in-cluster and rolls out automatically. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is filtered out of the app secret.
- deploy-openshift / deploy-code-engine skills and `deploy/README.md` rewritten around the
  two modes; `no-database` strips the Postgres manifest and boot migrator.
- Root `tsconfig.json` covering `scripts/` — the flavor/bootstrap scripts are now typechecked
  by `pnpm check`, lefthook, and the editor (they previously ran type-stripped and unchecked);
  `pnpm flavor finalize` removes it along with the scripts.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-09

Flavor composition: two flavors can now be applied together when the manifests declare it.

- Engine: `pnpm flavor apply <name> [<name>...]` applies flavors in order; `combinesWith`
  in a manifest whitelists a combination; overlays skip files an earlier flavor deleted;
  colliding files resolve via `flavors/<name>/combo/<other>/`; install + verify run once
  per invocation. Wrong order or untested pairs fail with an explanatory error.
- `oauth-proxy carbon` — the classic IBM-internal setup: Carbon UI behind company SSO
- `backend-only no-database` — stateless API services (e.g. watsonx Orchestrate tools)
- Setup skill interview is now scenario-driven: it recommends a configuration from what the
  project is (client-branded app, IBM-internal asset, SSO requirement, headless service)
- CI flavor matrix covers both combinations
- Verified against real agents: three setup scenarios run by weaker models on fresh clones;
  fixes from that exercise — flavor apply preserves a bootstrap-renamed compose project
  name, warns when a flavor changes `.env.example` under an existing `.env`,
  `cen.setupDone` renamed to `cen.bootstrapped`, placeholder favicon
- Release-audit fixes: `no-database` now also fixes the production Dockerfile and
  `.env.production.example`, removes inapplicable skills (as does `backend-only`), and
  `pnpm bootstrap` writes `.env` after flavors so flavored env examples land in it;
  invalid flavor sequences are rejected before any file changes

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-09

Initial release of the single-branch template (successor to `full-stack-cen-template`).

- Base app: Hono + zod-openapi backend (Swagger UI from the zod schemas), React/Vite/TanStack
  frontend with shadcn/ui and a Carbon-flavored theme, better-auth (email/password + admin),
  Drizzle + PostgreSQL, end-to-end types via Hono RPC (no codegen)
- Flavor engine: `pnpm flavor list/apply/finalize` with four flavors: `no-database`,
  `backend-only`, `oauth-proxy` (oauth2-proxy + bundled Dex for local dev), and `carbon`
  (full @carbon/react UI with Carbon-token Tailwind bridge)
- Agent surface: AGENTS.md (setup mode + runbook), `.agents/skills/` (setup, add-resource,
  add-page, db-migrations, deploy + debug for OpenShift and Code Engine)
- Backend test setup: vitest + in-memory PGlite running the real migrations
- Production: single container (API serves the SPA), kustomize manifests, idempotent
  `deploy/deploy.sh`, CI with a flavor matrix and a Postgres smoke job
- `pnpm bootstrap`: post-clone naming, remotes, `.env`, optional flavor apply
